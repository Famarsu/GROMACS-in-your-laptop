# Getting started
Let us start with the simplest system (also very well documented by Justin Lemkul)
**Lysozyme in water**
To avoid the hassle of downloading the files and clean those I have included all the necessary ones in the folder Lysozyme.
So, let's retrieve the folder in our laptop and start playing with it, to do that we can just run wget in the terminal:
1. If you don't have already installed we can use the same procedure as for installing GROMACS:
- **Linux**
```sudo apt-get install wget```
- **MacOS**
```brew install wget```
2. Use **wget** to download the files:
```wget https://github.com/jadgt/GROMACS-in-your-laptop/blob/main/Tutorial%20Example/Lysozyme.zip```
